# Walls

A simple two player board game where the first to the other side wins

This was one of my very early projects, looking at the codebase will tell you just how early

(I don't know why, but it's still one of my favourites)

# How to Play

- Players move one piece each turn

- Pieces can move by one space horizontally or vertically into empty tiles

- Lining up two or more pieces horizontally or vertically over any distance will create a wall

- If enemy pieces move into or are caught within a newly created wall, they cannot be moved

- Friendly pieces can move through your own walls without penalty

- If a player moves his/her piece to the other side of the board, they win

# Final Notes

There are very many noobish mistakes in this project, none of which actually affect
the playability of the game. Therefore, they will not be fixed
